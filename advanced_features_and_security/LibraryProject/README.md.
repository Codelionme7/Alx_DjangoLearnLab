# Advanced Features and Security

## Permissions and Groups Setup
This project implements a role-based access control system using Django's built-in permissions and groups.

### Custom Permissions
We have defined custom permissions on the `Book` model in `bookshelf/models.py`:

* `bookshelf.can_view`: Allows a user to view the list of books.
* `bookshelf.can_create`: Allows a user to create new book entries.
* `bookshelf.can_edit`: Allows a user to modify existing book entries.
* `bookshelf.can_delete`: Allows a user to remove book entries.

### Groups Configuration
The following groups are configured in the Django Admin to manage access:

1.  **Viewers**
    * **Permissions:** `can_view`
    * **Role:** Read-only access to the book list.

2.  **Editors**
    * **Permissions:** `can_view`, `can_create`, `can_edit`
    * **Role:** Can create and modify books but cannot delete them.

3.  **Admins**
    * **Permissions:** `can_view`, `can_create`, `can_edit`, `can_delete`
    * **Role:** Full administrative control over book entries.

### How to Test
1.  **Create Users:** Create test users via the Django Admin.
2.  **Assign Groups:** Assign users to the groups defined above.
3.  **Access Views:**
    * `can_edit` permission is required to access the edit view.
    * `can_create` permission is required to access the creation view.
    * Users without the correct permission will be denied access (403 Forbidden).
